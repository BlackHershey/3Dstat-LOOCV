# 3Dstat-LOOCV
LOOCV probing of utility of intermediate 3Dstat maps

A reviewer of [the Gourisankar et al paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/168302) requested that we do something like leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to estimate how well the statistical images made by the "3Dstat" ([Eisenstein et al 2014](https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.24204)) permutation approach to testing significance of DBS location-effect mapping predict benefit for a given effect of DBS, and how specific such predictions were (*e.g.* whether predictions for tremor differed meaningfully from predictions for affective valence). Discussing this request, we realized that we did not have to create N-1 new sets of statistical images for N subjects. Rather, if each subject contributed data at M contact locations, we could simply calculate N, weighted mean, t and p for those M points in space based on the data from the other N-1 subjects. Of course since the previous method relied on image-level software, the code would need to be rewritten, but it should run much faster and the results should take up essentially no disk space. So that's what this repository is about. Since I'm somewhat familiar with NumPy, that's what I'm using here.
